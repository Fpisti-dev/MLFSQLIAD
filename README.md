As the task of the final exam of my MSc studies, I chose the possible solution of Machine Learning and SQL Injection.

I used Microsoft ML.NET which is an open source and cross-platform machine learning framework. I tested the efficiency of different trainers using different training and testing datasets.

The created .NET application successfully ran these tests and reported the results of the tests.
